sentence=The first and only Arduino library where Geiger Counter and MQ Sensors combine with Data Science
paragraph=This library supports a wide range of gas sensors, including popular models like [MQ-2, MQ-3, MQ-4, MQ-5, MQ-6, MQ-7, MQ-8, MQ-9, MQ-131, MQ-135, MQ-136, MQ-137 MQ-303A, MQ-307A, MQ-309A] . It provides convenience by offering ready-made RL assignments for soldered models. It performs the calibration process through ready-made percentiles from gas to gas, rather than from sensor to sensor. You can also calculate resistor values for sensor analog readings from 0 to 100 without any physical sensor. The library provides separate support for external gas sensors, allowing you to easily calculate new a and b coefficients with Python Language (logarithm and regression). Additionally, it supports Geiger Counter models for radiation measurements, providing usv/hr, Avg, sdCPM, and CPM count values at customizable intervals. With built-in data export to CSV files, you can easily visualize sensor data and create reference lines for data-based DataScience projects using the Matplotlib library.
