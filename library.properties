sentence=The first and only Arduino library where Geiger Counter and MQ Sensors combine with Data Science
paragraph=This library supports a wide range of MQ gas sensors (MQ2, MQ3, MQ4, MQ5, MQ6, MQ7, MQ8, MQ9, MQ131, MQ131_LOW, MQ135, MQ136, MQ137, MQ138, MQ214, MQ216, MQ303A, MQ303B, MQ306A, MQ307A, MQ309A). Instead of sensor-specific calibration, it uses gas-specific reference percentages, enabling more accurate ppm calculations. Key features include automatic calculation of 'a' and 'b' coefficients via logarithmic regression; temperature and humidity compensation using a correction coefficient model; analytical and manual calibration support for unsupported MQ models; a JavaScript-based implementation for hardware-free testing and computation; built-in Geiger counter integration with radiation metrics such as ÂµSv/h and CPM; 3D ppm concentration graph simulation; and Python-based 4D ppm slope estimation for advanced data analysis.
