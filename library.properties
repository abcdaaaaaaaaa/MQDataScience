sentence=The first and only Arduino library where MQ Sensors combine with Data Science
paragraph=This library supports a wide range of MQ gas sensors (MQ-2, MQ-3, MQ-4, MQ-5, MQ-6, MQ-7, MQ-8, MQ-9, MQ131, MQ-131_LOW, MQ-135, MQ-136, MQ-137, MQ-138, MQ-214, MQ-216, MQ303A, MQ303B, MQ306A, MQ307A, MQ309A). Instead of sensor-specific calibration, it uses gas-specific reference percentages, enabling more accurate ppm calculations. Key features include automatic calculation of 'a' and 'b' coefficients via logarithmic regression; temperature and humidity compensation using a correction coefficient model; analytical and manual calibration support for unsupported MQ models; a JavaScript-based implementation for hardware-free testing and computation; 3D ppm concentration graph simulation; and Python-based 4D ppm slope estimation for advanced data analysis.
