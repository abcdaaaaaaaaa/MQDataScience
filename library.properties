sentence=This library allows you to read MQ sensors very easily and there is separate support in Radioactive kits such as Geiger Counter.
paragraph=This library reads MQ sensors datasheet [MQ-2 MQ-3 MQ-4 MQ-5 MQ-6 MQ7 MQ-8 MQ-9 MQ-131 MQ-135 MQ-136 MQ- 303A MQ-309A] can do analog reading of datasheet reading, offers you ready calibration values ​​besides the environment where you can calibrate your gas sensors, unlike other libraries. Also, without installing any sensor, how many k resistors would you want to use if you had only sensor and what value would it be if your sensor had an analog reading of 0-100? You can calibrate by answering the question. Also There is separate support for External Gas sensors. It calculates a and b values ​​for you . (Allows calculating without using a sensor, calculating percent caliber  with python) Shows you the percentage of the environment while calibrating your external sensor to the environment. You can use this feature to see the sensor percentage. Also Geiger Counter models and calculates usv/hr Avg sdCPM and CPM count values ​​at (your custom defined) second intervals.
