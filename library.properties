sentence=The first and only Arduino library where Geiger Counter and MQ Sensors combine with Data Science
paragraph=This library supports a wide range of gas sensors, including popular models like [MQ2, MQ3, MQ4, MQ5, MQ6, MQ7, MQ8, MQ9, MQ131, MQ135, MQ136, MQ137, MQ138, MQ214, MQ303A, MQ303B, MQ307A, MQ309A]. Calibrations calculated mathematically by the library are performed not per sensor but via more precise gas-based percentage references, allowing users to easily calculate ppm values. To enable accurate ppm calculation, the library calculates the a and b coefficients using logarithmic regression with Python. It also supports unsupported MQ models by enabling analytical calculation methods and correction coefficient integration. The correction coefficient models the environmental impact of temperature and humidity on ppm readings and compensates for these deviations mathematically. The library also offers a JavaScript-based implementation that allows users to perform all calculations independently from hardware. For radiation projects, it includes Geiger Counter support with multidimensional radioactive decay estimations, such as ÂµSv/h, average, standard deviation, and CPM values at customizable intervals. Finally, it features 3D sensor ppm concentration graph simulation (including sensor percentage and correction coefficient) and 4D ppm slope estimation for advanced data science applications.
