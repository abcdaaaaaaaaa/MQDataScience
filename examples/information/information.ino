Correction Coefficient: Mathematical modeling of the compensation of incorrect ppm rate measured due to negative effects of environmental conditions based on temperature and humidity of the sensor.

Standard Gases: Gases measured by correction coefficient supported "Standard Sensors".
Different Model Gases: Gases measured by "Standard Sensors" without correction coefficient support.
