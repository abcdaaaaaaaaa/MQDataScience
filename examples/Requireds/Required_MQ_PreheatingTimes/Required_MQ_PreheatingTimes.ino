  /* The graph shows the required preheating times specified in each sensor's datasheet as the most accurate operating points.
  *  The (↓) down arrow indicates that the ideal preheating time is less than that time, and the (↑) up arrow indicates that the ideal preheating time is more than that time. */

  // NOTES: Gas sensors must be preheated for a certain period before initial use. Failure to do so will result in unstable sensor outputs.
  // Preheating stabilizes the sensor's operating conditions, ensuring reliable and repeatable measurements.
  // This idle time of the sensor must be implemented with the appropriate resistor and voltage specified in the Requires folder.
