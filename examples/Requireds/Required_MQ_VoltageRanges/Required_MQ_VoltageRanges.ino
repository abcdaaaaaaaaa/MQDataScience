  /* The graph shows the required voltage ranges specified in each sensor's datasheet as the most accurate operating points.
  *  The ± symbol indicates the maximum voltage value that the sensor can tolerate above its ideal voltage value.
  *  Since the tolerance amount is not specified in the datasheet for some sensors, the tolerance amount for those sensors is not shown here either. */

  // NOTE: These are the voltages that need to be sent to the sensor, both for preheating and for standard ppm readings.
