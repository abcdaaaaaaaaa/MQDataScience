What does this code do?
This code simulates which gas will give which ppm result at which temperature and humidity for your sensor, at which sensor percentage.
After running this code, it saves the simulation as an html file customized for each gas.

What should I pay attention to?
To examine the high MB html files produced by this system without interruption in the browser, use vim when opening the files. 
Otherwise, it may experience problems while working in the browser due to the high MB.

Which sensors are covered by this simulation?
This simulation is for sensors with calculated correction coefficients. For the simulation of sensors without calculated correction coefficients, you can try ModelGraph.py
