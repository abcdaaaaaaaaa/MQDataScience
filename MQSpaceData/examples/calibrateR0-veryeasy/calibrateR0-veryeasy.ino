//!!!Definitely and definitely visit the information.ino file to see which sample you need!!!\\

//Calibrate your sensor very quickly and precisely WÄ°THOUT connecting the sensor 
//(remember, you can never provide 100% environment in a laboratory environment)
//Just tell us how many k resistors you would have connected if you had your sensor with you,
//and if you could meet the necessary conditions, how many value (like 27%) would you want 
//if your sensor were analog reading  0-100 in those. 
//and you would get the most accurate result with just the serial port screen (without using any sensor)!
